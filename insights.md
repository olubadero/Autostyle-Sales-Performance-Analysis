**Brief Insights:** Ekiti most likely made the lowest sales because it only sold for Three (3) Months, whilst other branches sold for Twelve (12) Months. However, when those Three (3) Months are compared across all branches, Ekiti still sold the least amount of vehicles.

To further analyse the likely reasons for the branches performance during the analysis period, I conducted an external analysis on environmental factors within Nigeria that could have led to this performance. To do this, I looked at the population and economic standing of the state branches to determine if it was a possible factor for performance.

**It was observed that Lagos has the highest population and the residents have the highest PAYE, whilst Ekiti has the lowest population and the lowest PAYE, so it can be said this may likely explain why the branches performed the way they did.**

The females purchased the most vehicles, 766, which is just a little above that of the males, 725. However, branch, brand and model purchases shows the disparity in purchases as some genders tend to dominate in different categories. 

## Insights Generated from the Analysis:

To generate the following insights, I used data from pivot tables and performed correlation analysis to extract likely reasons for sales performance across board.

- **The top 5 branches sold 99% of the company’s total sold cars as Ekiti only sold 17 cars.**

- **Top 5 selling car brands amounted to 90% of the total cars sold and they had more than 1 model. This proves variety likely increases a customers prospect to purchase.**

- **Here are the Top 8 of 17 selling Models and it is likely Genders chose based on their preference for these Models.**

- **These 2 age groups are likely to purchase these brands if available with variety of models.**

### **Likely Reasons for the sales downturn**

- Official COVID-19 lockdown began in Nigeria from the 30th of March, 2020 which lasted until the phase one easing of lockdown on the 4th of May, 2020. Thus, purchase of cars may not be a priority during this periods. There were also rumours of another round of lockdown around November due to surge of COVID-19 cases.

- Christian Lent and Muslim Ramadan fasting occurring between March -May period. Thus, extravagant spending may be reduced during this period.

- End of the year activities may also cause December slump because customers may have travelled for Christmas and New Years holiday.

### **Likely Reasons for the sales surge in July**

- Official COVID-19 third phase of the easing of the lockdown  from 1st of July, 2020 and the ban on interstate travels were lifted and reopening of airports.

## Recommendations

- **Relocate** the Ekiti branch and invest its resources into a new branch.

- Establish a **new branch** either in Lagos or states with similar characteristics as Lagos (i.e. population or economic capacity) e.g. Abuja F.C.T., Kano or Rivers state.

- Open a new **company website or social media page**, e.g. Instagram, that customers can access all around Nigeria, irrespective of lockdown, and boost sales.

- **Increase the models** of the top 6 brands to have a minimum of 3 models each to boost sales.

- Ensure state preferred models are always readily available and marketed to genders and age groups that favour those models.
  
- Marketing and Sales team should reconsider their strategies of **marketing** low performing brands and models to customers. 

- Consider running a **discount sales** on the low performing brands to observe if that boost sales, if not, then consider discontinuing them so the funds are invested in top selling brands and models.
